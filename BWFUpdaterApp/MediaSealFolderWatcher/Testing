Restore a file that is not encrypted
	! Are we getting the correct checksum 
	O Thumbs.db
	- Test Thumbs.db
	- clean up folder if files fail
	! case insensitive checksum comparison
	- need multipaths for the different ops as I am concerned that decrypts will fail

	Fixed the checksum issue as the checksums were delivered as upper case, mine were lower case
	ignoring Thumbs.db - must check
	files that do not have the proper checksum are pushed to the error box aswell as the original, ask Julian about this behavior.

	! single file dropped into audio ops
	! single file dropped into media ops
	! single file dropped into post ops
	! single file dropped into restore deliver

	tomorrow will test multiple file drops.
	manual decryption will not push out an email.
	
	encrypting single files is working, i have encrypted several files, particularly from job 365780


	So files can be created before folders
	Add email for duplicates on submission, I also added a file that was in a folder, but the file was in the outpath, so the job would never have completed.
	HANDLING BATCH FOLDERS WHEN THERE IS A DUPLICATE IN THE CHAIN
	FOLDERS THAT HAVE NO AM DATA WILL SIT IN BOX UNTIL RESOLUTION.

	If a file that gets processed has no daisy metadata associated with it, it get kicked back to the error box with an email
	If processing a batch file, and no daisy metadata data is found for the file, then the file gets reported as having an inaccurate checksum, and email is generated

	adding a folder which his missing a file and has one bad file
	need to add a timeout
